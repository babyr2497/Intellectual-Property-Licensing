# Decentralized Intellectual Property Licensing

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient management and monetization of intellectual property rights.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized solution for intellectual property registration, licensing, and royalty management. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a secure, automated system that streamlines IP transactions while ensuring proper attribution and compensation for creators and rights holders.

## Core Components

### IP Registration Contract
- Records ownership of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other IP assets
- Stores cryptographic proof of creation dates and authorship
- Manages transfer of IP ownership rights
- Links to off-chain documentation through secure hash verification
- Creates permanent, immutable record of intellectual property provenance

### License Terms Contract
- Defines usage rights, restrictions, and permitted applications
- Establishes royalty rates and payment structures
- Implements time-limited or perpetual licensing options
- Supports various licensing models (exclusive, non-exclusive, territorial)
- Enables customizable licensing terms for different use cases

### Usage Tracking Contract
- Monitors utilization of licensed intellectual property
- Records instances of IP usage across digital platforms
- Verifies compliance with license terms and restrictions
- Provides analytics on IP usage patterns and adoption
- Detects potential unauthorized usage

### Royalty Distribution Contract
- Automates royalty calculations based on actual usage
- Manages direct payments to rights holders and collaborators
- Handles multi-party royalty splits for collaborative works
- Provides transparent payment histories and reconciliation
- Supports various payment methods including cryptocurrency and fiat currency integrations
